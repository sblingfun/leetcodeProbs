//Math based problem,  each additional number of days in a row increases the number of combinations by 1
//So 2 days in a row has 1 combo 
//3 days in a row has 3 combos
//4 days in a row has 6
//5 days in a row has 10

//Relationship is that for each additional day in a row over 1 there is one more number of combos
//EX: 5 days in a row has 1 combo of length 5, 2 combos of length 4, 3 combos of length 3, 4 combos of length 2, (counting 5 combos of length 1 at the end)
// So for each day in a row over 1 add 1 to the number of combos added for that length
